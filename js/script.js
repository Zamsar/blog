// This file can contain any custom JavaScript for your website.
// For a simple static site like this, it might not be strictly necessary
// beyond linking in the HTML, but it's good practice to have it ready.

document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
    // Example: A subtle console log to confirm JS is loaded
    console.log("Zamir's Dev Log: JavaScript loaded!");

    // You could add logic here for:
    // - Smooth scrolling for navigation links
    // - Simple form validation (though submission needs a backend)
    // - Dynamic content loading (e.g., fetching posts from a JSON file)
});
